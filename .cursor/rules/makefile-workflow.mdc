# saml2aws-multi Development Workflow

## Build and Test Commands
Use the Makefile for all build and test operations:

### Build Commands
- `make build` - Build the Python package
- `make install-deps` - Install project dependencies
- `make install-test-deps` - Install test dependencies

### Test Commands
- `make test` - Run unit tests without coverage
- `make test-coverage` - Run unit tests with coverage reporting
- `make yamllint` - Run yamllint on GitHub workflow files

### Development Commands
- `make clean` - Clean test artifacts, build artifacts and temporary files
- `make help` - Show all available targets

## Project Structure
- Main package: `saml2awsmulti/`
- Tests: `saml2awsmulti/tests/`
- CLI entry point: `awslogin` (defined in pyproject.toml)
- Configuration: `pyproject.toml`

## Development Workflow
1. Install dependencies: `make install-deps`
2. Run tests: `make test` or `make test-coverage`
3. Build package: `make build`
4. Run application: `awslogin` (after installation)
5. Clean artifacts: `make clean`

## Python Environment
- Python 3.10+ required (uses Python 3.13 via uv)
- Uses uv for Python package management
- Uses setuptools for building
- Dependencies managed via pyproject.toml
- Test dependencies in optional-dependencies.test

## Code Quality
- Use `make yamllint` for YAML linting
- Use `make test-coverage` for comprehensive testing
- Clean up with `make clean` before commits
